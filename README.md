New in the world of programming - coming from analog labour in kitchens and caf√©'s - putting my brain to work for a change
Learning Python 3 at Udemy at this time, moving on to a full-time course in Java EE development come October 2018. 
Being more of a language person , starting with Python was, I believe, a good choice. Really love it and hope to learn much more.
